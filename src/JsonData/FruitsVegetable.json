          "amount": "13.8g",
          "description": "Apples are primarily composed of carbohydrates, accounting for about 13.8 grams in a medium-sized apple. These carbohydrates are mostly in the form of natural sugars such as fructose, glucose, and sucrose, which provide the body with quick energy. Despite their sugar content, apples have a low glycemic index, largely due to their fiber content, which helps slow down the digestion and absorption of sugar, preventing spikes in blood sugar. The carbohydrates in apples also include dietary fibers, such as pectin, which has various health benefits, including improved digestion and cholesterol levels."

          "description": "Fiber is an essential nutrient found in high quantities in apples, with a medium-sized apple providing about 2.4 grams of fiber. The fiber in apples is both soluble and insoluble, contributing to a host of health benefits. Soluble fiber, like pectin, helps manage weight by creating a feeling of fullness. It also helps control blood sugar levels and reduces cholesterol by binding with fats in the intestine. Insoluble fiber adds bulk to stool, which aids in moving food through the digestive system and preventing constipation. Regular consumption of high-fiber foods like apples is associated with a lower risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain types of cancer."
